# üöÄ Pathify ‚Äì Smarter Route Optimization  

Pathify is a route optimization platform designed to streamline delivery routes using **real-time communication**, **AI-powered decision-making**, and a **sleek, user-friendly interface**. Built during [**uOttaHacks7**](https://uottahacks.com/) (hosted by **uOttawa** and part of the [**Major League Hacking (MLH)**](https://mlh.io/) circuit), Pathify was a 36-hour hackathon project aimed at solving challenges in route efficiency for logistics and delivery systems.

## üí° Technologies Used  

### üì® [**Solace PubSub+**](https://solace.com/products/event-broker/pubsub-plus/):  
An event-driven messaging platform used to enable **real-time communication** between components. This allowed us to create a responsive system that updates route data dynamically as changes occur.  

### ü§ñ [**GROQ AI**](https://groq.com/):  
We implemented GROQ AI to handle **traffic predictions and dataset analysis**, adding intelligence to our route prioritization algorithms. GROQ AI enabled smarter planning by processing large datasets efficiently and making real-time decisions.

### üõ†Ô∏è [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/):  
Supabase served as the **backend** for Pathify, managing:  
- User authentication  
- Database storage for historical route analytics and user data  
- API calls to seamlessly integrate with the frontend  

### ‚ù§Ô∏è **Lovable UI/UX:**  
Our objective was not just to create a functional platform but to make it **easy to use and enjoyable** for end-users. The UI was designed with simplicity and real-time interaction in mind.

## üìã How It Works  

1. **Real-Time Data Streaming:** Solace PubSub+ ensures instant communication between backend systems and the client-side application.  
2. **Predictive AI Optimization:** GROQ AI processes live and historical data, optimizing routes based on factors such as traffic and delivery priorities.  
3. **Backend Processing:** Supabase securely stores user data, delivery history, and route analytics while handling authentication.  
4. **User Interaction:** A simple interface allows end-users to view optimized routes and interact with live delivery updates.
